It is based on Curve\'s vote escrow (ve) model and each YFI token can be locked for up to 4 years (technically longer, but there is no added voting or earning power gained by locking for more than 4 years). The length of lock determines how much veYFI is received per locked YFI. One YFI locked for four+ years converts to one veYFI. This relationship scales linearly, so one YFI locked for two years converts to 0.5 veYFI, one year converts to 0.25 veYFI, and so forth.","sidebar":"mySidebar"},"governance/yfi":{"id":"governance/yfi","title":"YFI","description":"The YFI token is a tool for coordination between Yearn\'s contributors, community and associated protocols.
